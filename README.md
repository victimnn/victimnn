# Hi, I'm Victor! 👋

👨‍💻 **Developer focused on C# and systems development**  
I work on development projects, especially with C# and Windows Forms, where I'm building systems like a library with book registration, form navigation, and login functionalities. I prioritize data organization and database consistency to ensure everything runs efficiently.

💼 **Interests in AI and NLP**  
I'm fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP). I enjoy learning about how vectors and language models are applied in AI, and I aim to develop applications that use semantic search techniques and generative AI in the future.

⚙️ **Technologies I study:**  
- **C# and .NET** for desktop application development
- **SQL** for database management and manipulation
- **Python** for data processing and AI
- **Artificial Intelligence** and **NLP**, exploring machine learning foundations and applying them in recommendation systems and sentiment analysis

🌐 **Constantly Seeking Improvement**  
I work collaboratively and adaptably, open to new challenges and always eager to learn. I value knowledge exchange and building projects that have a positive impact.
